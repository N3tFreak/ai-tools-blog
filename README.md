# AI Tools for Students & New Developers – Static Site

This folder contains the complete source for a small niche website built
entirely with static HTML and CSS. It is intended as a starting point for
your own AI‑driven blog, particularly if you are a student or new
developer looking to monetise your knowledge by sharing insights about
artificial intelligence tools and resources.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Home page listing summaries of all blog posts.
- `about.html` – A page describing the purpose of the site.
- `posts/` – Directory containing five example posts.
- `styles.css` – A simple stylesheet applied to all pages.
- `README.md` – This file, with setup and customisation instructions.

## Customising the Content

All pages are written in plain HTML. To update them:

1. Open the desired `.html` file in a code editor.
2. Modify the text, headings or links as needed.
3. Save your changes. No build step is required since this is a static site.

### Adding Affiliate Links

Each post contains a placeholder labelled `affiliate link`. To monetise your
site, sign up for affiliate programs (e.g., Amazon Associates, Udemy or
other software providers) relevant to your niche. Replace the placeholder
text with your own affiliate URL. For example:

```html
<a href="https://example.com/your-affiliate-id">GitHub Copilot subscription</a>
```

When visitors click the link and make a purchase, you’ll earn a small
commission. According to industry surveys, affiliate marketers can earn
around $8,000 per month on average【22†L266-L274】, though results vary.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

You can host this static site for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Below is a summarised setup process:

1. **Create a repository** on GitHub. If you want the site to appear at
   `<username>.github.io`, name your repo exactly that (replace
   `<username>` with your GitHub username). Otherwise you can use any
   repository name【707943316244679†L144-L156】.
2. **Add the site files** to the repository. You can upload them via the
   GitHub web interface or push them using Git.
3. **Select a publishing source**. Go to the repository settings,
   scroll to **Pages**, and choose the branch (usually `main`) and root
   folder as the source【707943316244679†L144-L166】. The entry file must
   be `index.html` or `README.md` at the top level.
4. **Wait for deployment**. GitHub will build and deploy your site using
   GitHub Actions. It can take a few minutes for your site to be live【707943316244679†L188-L189】.
5. **Visit your site**. Under the GitHub Pages section, click “Visit
   site.” Your website will be accessible at
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

For more detailed instructions, see GitHub’s official documentation【707943316244679†L144-L156】.

## Next Steps

- Continue adding posts by creating new HTML files in the `posts/` directory.
- Use AI tools like ChatGPT to draft content quickly, but always edit for
  accuracy and readability.
- As your traffic grows, consider adding display ads or creating your own
  digital products like eBooks or mini‑courses【22†L237-L245】【11†L61-L69】.
- Remember to prioritise value for your readers; monetisation works best
  when you build trust and provide genuine help.

We hope this template helps you kick‑start your journey into the world
