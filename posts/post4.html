        <p>Once your blog starts attracting readers, there are several ways to earn income without overwhelming your visitors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Affiliate marketing</strong>: Join programs like Amazon Associates or Udemy. Recommend products or courses relevant to your niche and earn a commission whenever someone makes a purchase through your link. This method has low start‑up costs and can scale well【22†L266-L274】.</li>
            <li><strong>Display ads</strong>: Use networks like Google AdSense or Ezoic to place ads on your site. As your traffic grows, ad revenue can provide a steady stream of passive income【22†L237-L245】. Avoid placing too many ads early on; focus on user experience first.</li>
            <li><strong>Sell digital products</strong>: Package your own knowledge into eBooks, guides or online courses. Digital products have high margins because you create them once and sell them repeatedly【11†L61-L69】. For example, you could compile your AI productivity tips into a PDF and sell it via Gumroad.</li>
            <li><strong>Sponsored posts</strong>: Once you have a loyal audience, companies may pay you to review or mention their products. Always disclose sponsorships and only promote products you genuinely believe in.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regardless of which methods you choose, always prioritise providing value to your readers. Monetisation should enhance the experience, not detract from it.</p>
