        <p>Learning to code can be challenging, but advances in AI have produced a new generation of smart assistants that make it easier than ever. Here are five tools we recommend for students and new developers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>ChatGPT</strong> – This conversational AI helps you understand concepts, generate code snippets and debug errors. Be sure to verify the output and learn from the suggestions rather than simply copying and pasting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> – Built on models from OpenAI, Copilot integrates directly into your editor to suggest entire functions or complete missing code. It’s like pair programming with an AI and can accelerate learning when used responsibly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tabnine</strong> – A lightweight autocomplete tool powered by machine learning that works with many languages. It shines in providing context‑aware completions and saving time on routine tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Replit Ghostwriter</strong> – If you use Replit for coding, Ghostwriter offers AI‑powered code completion and explanations in the browser. It’s great for beginners looking for a seamless experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Codeium</strong> – An open‑source coding assistant focusing on privacy. Codeium runs models locally and works offline, giving you autonomy and security while learning.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These tools can dramatically speed up your learning. However, it’s important to understand the code they generate. Treat AI suggestions as a learning aid and double‑check everything yourself.</p>
