        <p>Studying smart beats studying hard. Here are some ways AI tools can help you stay organised and retain information more effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI‑powered note‑taking</strong>: Apps like Notion AI and Evernote integrate generative models to summarise lectures and organise notes automatically. You can ask them to rewrite your notes for clarity or generate flashcards for self‑testing.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalised learning plans</strong>: Platforms such as Khan Academy and Coursera use AI to recommend lessons based on your progress. They adjust difficulty levels and suggest extra practice to strengthen weak areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling assistants</strong>: Tools like Reclaim.ai help plan your study sessions around other commitments. They automatically reschedule tasks if conflicts arise, ensuring you never miss an important revision window.</li>
            <li><strong>Language models for clarification</strong>: When you encounter a difficult concept, ask a model like ChatGPT to explain it in simple terms. This can save hours of confusion and help you grasp the fundamentals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By offloading repetitive tasks to AI, you free up mental energy for deeper learning. Remember to cross‑check facts and formulas — models can make mistakes.
