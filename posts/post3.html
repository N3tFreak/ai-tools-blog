        <p>This very website is an example of how you can launch a niche blog using AI with almost no upfront cost. Here’s how we did it:</p>
        <h2>1. Select a niche</h2>
        <p>We chose "AI Tools for Students & New Developers" based on personal interests and the growing demand for trustworthy information on AI productivity tools. Picking a niche you care about increases your chance of staying motivated and producing quality content.</p>
        <h2>2. Generate content using AI</h2>
        <p>Instead of spending weeks writing articles from scratch, we leveraged a language model to draft the initial versions. We then edited these drafts to ensure accuracy and clarity. This approach allowed us to create multiple posts in just a few hours.</p>
        <h2>3. Build a simple static site</h2>
        <p>Using basic HTML and CSS we created a lightweight site that’s free to host on platforms like GitHub Pages. Static sites are fast, secure and easy to maintain. If you’re comfortable with frameworks, you can also use generators like Jekyll or Hugo.</p>
        <h2>4. Plan monetisation early</h2>
        <p>Although our site doesn’t yet display ads or affiliate links, we structured the content to naturally accommodate them. As traffic grows, we can join affiliate programs and insert links where appropriate. We can also add ads once we meet the minimum traffic requirements.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to replicate this project, download our source files (<strong>link provided below</strong>) and modify them for your own niche. Hosting via GitHub Pages is completely free and only requires a GitHub account.</p>
